# Bellocker — your intelligent AdBlocker

**Bellocker** is an AI-powered browser extension that doesn’t just block ads — it understands them.

Traditional adblockers use static rules and filters. Bellocker uses LLMs to analyze the **meaning** of content, detect **native ads**, sponsored blocks, promotional noise, and clean your web experience with precision.

## 🧠 Why Bellocker?

- 🔍 **Blocks by Meaning** — Not just hiding ad elements, but detecting intent using AI  
- 🧹 **Adaptive** — Learns what *you* consider an ad (with optional user feedback loop)  
- 🧘 **Focus Mode** — Auto-hides sidebars, popups, and distractions while reading  
- 🔐 **Privacy-Friendly** — No trackers, no third-party analytics  
- 🧾 **Descriptive Blocking** — Know what was blocked and why (optional transparency)
